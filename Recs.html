						<h3>The Temple of the Golden Pavillion</h3>
						<p>
							The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (金閣寺, Kinkaku-ji) is a novel by the Japanese author Yukio Mishima. It was published in
							1956 and translated into English by Ivan Morris in 1959.
							The novel is loosely based on the burning of the Reliquary (or Golden Pavilion) of Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto by a young
							Buddhist acolyte in 1950. The pavilion, dating from before 1400, was a national monument that had been spared
							destruction many times throughout history, and the arson shocked Japan.

							The story follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an unloved orphan in 18th-century France who is born with an exceptional
							sense of smell, capable of distinguishing a vast range of scents in the world around him. Grenouille becomes a perfumer
							but later becomes involved in murder when he encounters a young girl with an unsurpassed wondrous scent.
