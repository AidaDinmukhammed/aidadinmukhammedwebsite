							<h3>"The Catcher in the Rye"</h3>
							<p>
								I remember reading this book back in high school around the time J.D. Salinger passed away. It is a VERY interesting story.
						The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a poignant exploration of teenage alienation and the struggles of growing up.
						The novel follows Holden Caulfield, a disillusioned 16-year-old who has been expelled from his prestigious prep school
						and spends a few days wandering New York City. Narrated in a distinctive, colloquial voice, Holden's cynical and often
						erratic observations reveal his deep sense of loneliness, confusion, and his desire to protect innocence. Though
						sometimes criticized for its meandering plot and Holden's unreliability as a narrator, the book remains a powerful
						examination of the challenges of adolescence, identity, and the search for meaning. Its themes of alienation and the
						clash between innocence and experience continue to resonate with readers today.

								<h3>"Crime and Punishment"</h3>
								<p>
									Reviews are part where one inspired to go or atleast have a look. The all scene revolved around a murder. Crime and Punishment is a profound exploration of morality, guilt, and redemption, set against the backdrop of
									19th-century St. Petersburg. The novel follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a troubled former student who plans and executes the
									murder of a pawnbroker, believing he is above the law. However, his psychological unraveling after the crime exposes the
									inner turmoil of his conscience.
									
									Dostoevsky masterfully delves into the human psyche, examining themes of isolation, the burden of sin, and the search
									for salvation. The novel's complex characters—especially Raskolnikov, who vacillates between arrogance and despair—are
									hauntingly real and deeply introspective. The pacing can be slow at times, but the philosophical and moral dilemmas make
									it a compelling read.
									
									Ultimately, Crime and Punishment is a timeless meditation on the consequences of moral transgression and the possibility
									of redemption, making it one of the cornerstones of classic literature.
